# 🏡 House Price Prediction

![banner for 'House Price Prediction'  The design should feature a modern city skyline with houses, a price graph overlay, and a futurist](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48236b89-511f-4b03-8d84-200b858dc0a7)


## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using **machine learning models**. It leverages various **features like location, square footage, number of rooms, and other factors** to determine the estimated house price. The dataset is analyzed through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, feature engineering, and model building to ensure accurate predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used contains information on:
- **House Features:** Square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.
- **Location Data:** Region, zip code, or city.
- **Market Trends:** House price fluctuations over time.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature scaling and transformation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing house price trends.
   - Correlation between features and price.
   - Identifying outliers and anomalies.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared Score
   - Cross-validation performance

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
